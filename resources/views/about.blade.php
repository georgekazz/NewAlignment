            Ontology matching is a crucial problem in the world of Semantic Web and other distributed, open world
            applications. Diversity in tools, knowledge, habits, language, interests and usually level of detail may drive
            in heterogeneity. Thus, many automated applications have been developed, implementing a large variety of
            matching techniques and similarity measures, with impressive results. However, there are situations where this
            is not enough and there must be human decision in order to create a link.

        <code>
            We present Alignment, a collaborative, system aided, user driven ontology matching application. Alignment offers
            a simple GUI environment for matching two ontologies/vocabularies with aid of configurable similarity
            algorithms. We undertake research for the evaluation and validation of the default settings, taking into account
            expert users feedback. Multiple users can work on the same project simultaneously. The application offers also
            social features, as users can vote, providing feedback, on the produced linksets. The linksets are available
            through a SPARQL endpoint and an API. Alignment is the outcome of the experience working with heterogeneous
            public budget data, and has been used to align SKOS Vocabularies describing budget data across diverse level of
            administrations of the EU and its member states.
